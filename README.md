# AirBnB_clone

# Description of the project

This is the first part of the project that simulates an airbnb application in which we are creating a way to control the modules that our web page is going to use by intervening a database in json format. Here we apply object oriented programming, python data translation and command interpreted logic to deliver a local database that can be modified by commands.

# Prerequisites
